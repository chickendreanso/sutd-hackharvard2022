    "With rapid industrialisation of modern society, social solidarity has become increasingly deficient; a direct result of the individualism that capitalism promotes. As Emile Durkheim famously said, “The role of solidarity is not to suppress competition, but to moderate it.” (Durkheim, 1933), society functions on social solidarity. Therefore, authorities need to recognise this and foster it to achieve maximum social efficiency. Recent investigations into online fast fashion retailer, Boohoo, have revealed that they have been exploiting their workers, ignoring health and safety risks by forcing them to work through the COVID-19 pandemic with wages below minimum wage regulations (“The Guardian view on Boohoo,” 2020). This begs the question if the profit driven mindset of large companies can align with the ideals of social solidarity, through restitutive regulations placed by unions and government bodies. \nDurkheim believed that specialisation was necessary for moral order as this would bring about a unified interdependence of individuals in society. However, when individuals over specialise without any organic solidarity, as seen in the plight of the Boohoo workers, the door opens for the exploitation of workers. Boohoo’s factory workers, predominantly of south Asian and east European descent (“The Guardian view on Boohoo,” 2020), lack a collective conscious that unites them to fight for their rights. This coupled with the unenforced wage regulations and health and safety inspections by the relevant authorities (“Revealed: ‘shocking’ lack of regulation,” 2020) only exacerbates the anomie present. Not only are they being made to work in unsafe working conditions, they are being paid only “£3-£4 an hour” (Bland, 2020), with the hyper contagious nature of the COVID-19 virus also putting the lives of their family members in jeopardy. \nWhile intervention by the authorities, through restitutive law, would be the Durkheimian way to resolve the situation, monetary compensation might be insufficient stimulus to produce changes in their production methods. Over regulation could also lead to Boohoo simply moving its operations elsewhere, since they are a large online retailer experiencing high levels of growth. Hence, the most effective solution might be targeting the consumers of Boohoo, educating them on the impacts of their consumption on the lives of the workers who produce the goods they consume. With a large portion of Boohoo’s target demographic, between the “16-30 age range” (“The Guardian view on Boohoo,” 2020), being millennials, appealing to their sense of social responsibility could lead to decreased consumption of Boohoo’s goods, thereby motivating Boohoo to improve its production methods, leading to better treatment of its factory workers. \nWith the increasing complexity of modern societies due to globalisation, Durkheim’s theories on class divide being necessary for the growth of capitalism are valid, on the precondition that social solidarity is present to create a unifying interdependence between individuals. However, when social solidarity cannot be formed due to forced division of labour, low-skilled workers have no choice but to act out of rationality instead of working with an innate desire. This puts them at the mercy of capitalists who can take advantage of their desperation. Restitutive regulations, suggested by Durkheim, implemented by the relevant authorities also have their limitations. The high levels of competition in capitalistic societies offers a more effective solution, by reducing the competitiveness of these companies through consumer education; proving that the solutions Durkheim proposed were time-bound and most effective during his time only.",

    "With the advent of globalisation, a result of Western colonialism, widespread consumerism has started to see its negative impacts on the global community in recent years. Raised in Pakistan, Muslim artist Rashid Rana grew up in a third-world society which endured the brunt of global consumerism, seen in the widespread child labour that permeated Pakistan since the 1990s (Toor, 2001). Rana’s Offshore Accounts is a photomosaic, which seeks to portray the duality that lies within global consumerist culture. Upon closer inspection, one realises the seemingly calm image of the ocean is composed of smaller pictures of trash, debris, and colonial ships. This visual irony critiques the issues embedded within the power dynamics of globalisation; displaying Trouillot’s concept of how power “corroborate[s] the crux of the peasant’s story and some of its amazing details” (Trouillot, 1995). \nIntrigued by the effect that geography has on identity, especially in regions colonised in the past (Leghari, 2017), Rana’s artmaking is rooted in his unique cultural upbringing. With growing islamophobia, a result of the 9/11 terror attacks, Muslims across the world faced fear and discrimination due to the West’s anti-Muslim agenda. This was only exacerbated by globalisation as the West has the largest influence over the world, having previously been the colonial superpowers of the world. People’s perception of Muslims became increasingly negative, resulting in the suppression of their voices in society, illustrating Trouillot’s concept of how power enables the shaping of the narrative (Trouillot, 1995).  In Offshore Accounts, Rana presents a different perspective on consumerism and globalisation, approaching the topic as a ‘victim’ of a globalised world. \nThe medium of art allowed Rana to convey his ideas to a wider audience by engaging them with his work first, without any prior judgements of him; an obstacle one faces being a Muslim from a less developed country. Rana wanted to showcase the harmful results of globalisation, such as environmental damage and the plight of less developed countries left behind. The purposeful title, Offshore Accounts, references the economic term for wealth deposition into foreign lands to exploit lower taxes; a reflection of how first-world countries modernised and amassed their wealth by exploiting other countries’ resources. This inequality in a supposed mutually beneficial process is articulated through visual irony. While the small photos of trash and debris, together with the images of colonial ships, represent the result of globalisation, the latter is portrayed by the vast ocean formed by the smaller photos. This decision is impactful and apt as the seas were the first medium of transport that allowed globalisation to take place, with the invention of ships. \nBy using diametrically opposed subjects, Rana delivers a shocking visual irony to his audience when they realise his intent upon viewing his work up close. This manner of conveying his intent is analogous to how the merits of globalisation have blinded us to the harm that it has caused unless we closely examine its effects. The consequences of seemingly insignificant actions, as seen in global consumerist behaviour, get lost in the big picture but accumulate to produce a large, destructive impact that is only realised by connecting the repercussions of  the two phenomena portrayed. By “confronting the viewer with familiar imagery or easily rendable visuals […] to make my [Rana’s] work more engaging and accessible” (East, 2011), not only is a wider audience reached, but its impact on them is also elevated as the subjects dealt with are extremely relatable.",
    "Rana’s Offshore Accounts presents viewers with the ugly side of globalisation by showcasing its destructive tendencies and scale, an opinion which is equally valid although not usually heard. In modern day, with widespread access to information, it is important that voices such as Rana’s are not silenced as they also contribute significantly to the accuracy of the narrative being shaped. With his unique upbringing and position influencing his work, Rana reaffirms Trouillot’s ideas of how power influences the historical narrative. \n\n(639 words)",

    "Isnt that area on negative side greather than the function",
    "Less than is more negative whay",
    "Liddat means the way we split the inequality is wrong",

    "Yeah ik",

    "HAHA",

    "But r the exams legit like that?",
    "Ooh",
    "But maybe I think his thinking is like the istd mods r individual one whereas design mods r grp based",
    "So favours ppl who r btr in istd mods than the other way",
    "In that sense",
    "But studio mods r the bulk of them which will be grp mah",

    "for the ux designer they prefer someone that gonna grad soon cos they want someone more for the long term",
    "maybe not now uh",
    "but she passed my details to her manager alr who will contact me abt the work for the other start up",

    "Sure",
    "they yr grp for entre uh?",
    "oohh HAHA",
    "ya ofc",
    "the problem can actually expand on beyond what u listed",
    "definitely thats 1 issue",
    "1 issue i tot of was customisability of the blends",
    "like for eg. pre workout formulas have many diff blends of ingredients and even within the same class of ingredient there exists diff forms of itself ie. creatine monohydrate, creatine hcl, creatine nitrate which manufacturers sometimes falsely market to help sell or differentiate their product",
    "so if u go the customisability route it would appeal to the educated gym goer",
    "not neccessarily",
    "i think u can group it into pre workout and post workout",
    "they can come in both forms",
    "ya so the machine could also have recipes that we deisgn also for ppl who dont want the customisability",
    "is like yr fruit juice stall",
    "no pills will be taken orally",
    "but i would not want to go there cos i think the idea of taking pills to the average gym goer is more 'scary'",
    "i think u prob dont need to mix it with water for the person",
    "just dispense the powder then they can add water on their own n mix",
    "but if u could then its a bonus uh",
    "oh ya most these powdered supplements can be bought unflavoured so u could potentially allow for ppl to choose what flavours they want",
    "im not too sure from like the companies side when they produce in bulk but i would prob take the numbers from a brand like myprotein",
    "cos i think they offer the best value for the price",
    "ya the math works out to just above 2 bucks a serving",
    "water is sufficient i feel ppl use other drinks like milk or milo cos the powder's own flavor is not that great thats y they need sth else to make it more palatable",
    "pre workout i would want creatine caffiene citruline malate maybe beta alanine whereas post workout i would want my whey protein bcaas n creatine maybe if im in a period where im trg w creatine",
    "these r the main ingredients i would look out for",
    "if possible ofc wud be btr",
    "HAHA",
    "i think if the machine have a screen then u select can liao",
    "maybe not let them select how much exact weight of powder they want but how many servings they want which will be preset alr",
    "like the amt to dispense for 1 serving is alr preset",
    "they just pick how many servings they want",
    "this one u can choose how many grams u want so they charge per gram",
    "ya la cos targeting ppl who gym but i feel the number of ppl who gym has been n is still increasing due to ppl becoming more health conscious",
    "yeah ive seen that machine b4",
    "interesting uh but the thing ppl r unsure of now is whether the whole gym or workout from home idea will still prevail post covid",
    "just look at peloton now",
    "i honestly also am not sure which will be the case",
    "i guess but i feel its harder to keep a customer using that model unless they really enthu n buy into the system",
    "it can v easily become the exercise contraption u see when u visit someone's hse that sits n collects dust lol",

    "this wk shall we focus in the refinement of the draft and perhaps start planning how to do the data analysis?",
    "So far we have shifted the content that is more or less confirmed to the final report doc. Then  the comments that prof gave have been rectified less the gender and genre emphasis that acqquilaa and zixuan r working on as well as the smoothening out of the overall flow of the report. Ive gone through the data and am in the process of filtering out the stuff that is relevant to our scope",
    "i guess for now it would be to oversee the changes we r making to the report now that we r narrowing our study to focus on the effect of genre and gender. We also havent discussed the plan for the data analysis yet as well as who wants to do it",
    "yo for the analysis u can take a look at what enjie n i have done so far in the notebook on deepnote titled clean.ipynb. We still need to tag genres to the games b4 we can do the comparisons across genres but other than that i think H1 n H2 shud be covered alr",
    "hi isaac for rq1 i saw in the report we mentioned that we will do a multiple regression analysis to determine the strength of the relationship between time spent playing and affective well being but im not q sure how to do so. So far I have done an ANCOVA on affective well being and time spent playing. How do we proceed from here?",
    "can sth like this work?",
    "ya i made a mistake here",
    "ive changed it to time spent in the x axis alr",
    "sure gws man",
    "also just to check does negative effect size mean negative correlation?",

    "Oh ya can help me take a look at the analysis part for RQ1",
    "The data is v inconclusive",
    "Not sure how to conclude",
    "Cos the regression and ancova gave different correlations",
    "Ok sure",
    "Can",
    "Err i cant speak for zixuan as i didn't really work much with him but for acquillaa she did do her parts assigned to her and for enjie he actually helped q abit to set up the deepnote and clean the data",

    "So i didn't",
    "Sure",
    "for the time spent playing video games do u think its btr to split the data by quartiles or split it based on whether it is excessive or non excessive",
    "so far i have found studies that reccomend 2hrs a day as excessive",
    "but this is for teens",
    "there arent any studies i have seen so far that looked at adults",
    "prof also told us to do a tukey pairwise test after the ancova to verify the results",
    "I just consulted with prof abt this he says that is up to us so yea like u said if we choose excessive we need to explain how we get the threshold. Otherwise another option is to just use the median of the data",
    "Yeah so i think we will stick with the quartiles",
    "But as to whether just by median or by like 25th 50th n 75th we havent decided",
    "So after doing this actually the only significant result we have is the animal crossing one where wellbeing increased with playtime",
    "Prof was q fascinated by this n ask if we want to do more thorough analysis n publish this as a actual journal haha",
    "Haha i think we need to actually cfm the game time data first whether it is self reported or actually from the telemetry",
    "I honestly am not keen as i will be leaving sg nxt wk alr for exchange",
    "So will be q difficult to continue this straight away",
    "Yup",

    "ive updated the analysis plan to include the splitting of the data and the use of the post hoc testing",
    "isaac, I need to hop off the call to settle the matter i was attending to before. Can you update me on the progress of the data cleaning when enjie n zixuan r done then i will do up the analysis and discussion of the results of the data in the report following the feedback on the procedure that was reccomended by prof just now",

    "nvm uh only 3 clusters haha",
    "thats not the pt of this study tho",
    "if they r satisfied then they will not change the label",
    "unless they just anyhow",
    "thats more for surveys that take v long to complete leh",
    "ours alr v short",
    "Yea sounds gd",
    "30% still too high i feel",
    "if >10% copy paste i think is fine",

    "i think im more or less done with the data analysis yall can take a look",
    "Idk how to fix the axis lol bit by right is 0 to 1",
    "Based on the anova p value is greater than significant level so u cannot reject the null hyp which is our claim",
    "Thats y is inconclusive",
    "U can postulate that as a possibility but u cant say that definitively",
    "Ya",
    "Thats y i mention in the results pg that in future if we were to continue testing we need larger sample size to prove statistical significance then we can prove or disprove our claim",
    "Theres no report",
    "Just poster n presentation tmr",
    "Ya all that can go in a jornal entry",
    "Ya correct which was focusing on whether ppl prefer longer or shorter labels",
    "Which we cannot prove becos the data is not significant enough due to too many ppl not changing labels",
    "So if u actually remove the datapoints of those who nvr make changes",
    "We observe this^ but u cannot say this as a claim cos the data is not significant enough to prove this",
    "U need to conduct more studies then eliminate those 0 changes datapoints then see if u have significant data to make this conclusion",
    "can someone help me try to fix the x axis in the hist with the scale only to 0.6 by making it up till 1",

    "I think the scenarios focus on the interest one bah cos the back stuff is not the main feature for this sprint",
    "Yenching also say those pgs don fall under any feature",
    "Err can la i think",
    "My errors i had is not error msg",
    "Is jus cannot pass",
    "So after u done with yr stff can merge",
    "Yea",
    "The help button can do the scenarios alr",
    "The functionality has been implemented",
    "Bit was any scenarios written for it b4?",
    "Like on miro",
    "Ooh",
    "I think need to ask brandon what functionalities will be done then we can do for that",
    "I see",
    "Yea he said it is working partially",
    "Now that the branch has been merged which branch can we work on uh",
    "Ok thanks",
    "i added the check for the others button to show more content",
    "and the help button feature file",
    "commit n push liao",
    "the sprint 3 scenarios only left the check error msgs n the help button",
    "for some reason i cant run the tests i wrote in the help button feature file",
    "theres some parse error",
    "i only have this so far",
    "i don get whats wrong",
    "ya",
    "but i cant run them while the help icon feature file is inside cos of the error",
    "Ohh",
    "oh shit wat",
    "the error msg all undefined cos no fullstop at the end of the feature sentence",
    "HAHA",
    "nwo left the dbs card pg only",
    "like this then it passed",
    "but the dbs card page i think got the issue that yc said thats y got problem",
    "wait i push n commit then u try",
    "done",
    "wait all pass on my side",
    "nicee",
    "Can help to merge",
    "I gotta go run some errands now",
    "Idk",
    "Bryce side fail",
    "It did just now",
    "The error i got prev not even the same as his one",
    "Oh u tried uh",
    "Shud be ok alr uh since no reply from him yet",
    "What scenarios r they talking abt uh",
    "We missed those pgs?",
    "shucks",
    "wait so is jus others tin and upload residency?",
    "have the feature files been created?",
    "i  don see them even after pulling",
    "i checked sprint-3 and our scenarios branch both don have",
    "im making now",
    "wym?",
    "the feature files for the missing pgs r not there",
    "so im making them",
    "actually the pgs q simple",
    "can finish v fast one",
    "chey",
    "ya but theres no feature file",
    "he say switch to the video icon branch",
    "then work from there",
    "ya",
    "this is fresh branch from sprint 3",
    "Jus to cfm by 12nn jus need to submit the feature file but we can continue working on making them pass afterwards right?",
    "Ok",
    "for some reason the new radio option scenarios dont work with the old steps we used for prev sprints",
    "i use the same phrasing",
    "and have the inputids alr",
    "but doesnt pass",
    "cannot read null error",
    "correct eh",
    "wait i try fetch n pull again",
    "oh",
    "then u push n commit to the branch can",
    "i do this still cant pass",
    "the most updated branch is feat/video-icon-scenarios",
    "u going to studio to do sds?",
    "no",
    "left the dropdown on other-tin",
    "need to find a way to click on dropdown and click on the correct country",
    "do u know what raph is refering to for the new scenarios for this sprint",
    "So need to check that video is playing in tge background?",
    "Thats all",
    "ahh i see",
    "hmm",
    "i ask yc who doing that",
    "brandon doing",
    "no i havent try",
    "pushed alr?",

    "i havent try so i not sure how to help",
    "shud ask brandon uh",
    "i see",
    "thanks",
    "ok sure",
    "not implementing uh",
    "idk im asking",

    "wah",
    "ok then",
    "Idk sia",
    "I go check",
    "If havent then we jus say waiting on this",
    "Last update was 2 days ago leh",
    "For sprint 4 branch",
    "The localhost 3000 fixed alr?",

    "U joined the gmeet alr?",
    "Wait uh",
    "Lol really",
    "What r we supposed to do sia lol",
    "I tot raph gonna present the whole thing",
    "Lol",
    "",
    "Hey I havent actually tried yet or have any exp in doing this kind of analysis",
    "I was mainly cleaning the data",
    "Haha same here",
    "I tot could jus use sklearn n matplot to do",
    "Can can",
    "I see",
    "Sounds gd",
    "i think whats left is just to do ANCOVA for each game with dv=SPANE covar=['age','gender'] between=total minutes then we compare the scores across the genres",
    "actually i did alr",
    "ya i used the survey data",
    "i think in that case no need the telemetry",
    "cos is only the time spent playing",
    "n since they combine then we can jus pull everything from the survey data",
    "oh",
    "is it the same one as in the survey data?",
    "oh but the telemetry cannot tag to the user",
    "i just took the time from the col 'total minutes' for the ancova here",
    "hmm",
    "if the times r the same then no diff uh",
    "but if not then shud use the telemetry one i guess",
    "i think we just find a study that shows what is considered as excessive video game time then we split the data acc to excessive and not excessive game time",
    "i mean can also but i tot split into 2 would be easier uh",
    "i trying to find a study now",
    "wait how come 25th is 0",
    "huh",
    "shud we just exclude them",
    "i think we remove ba",
    "the total time col is over what period of time uh?",
    "so far im seeing abt 5hrs a day is excessive alr",
    "wah",
    "thats in minutes right",
    "ok for the time do u now how this is collected like whether is it per wk?",
    "i see",
    "yeah we should",
    "cos the one prev done is incorrectly done",
    "like what prof said",
    "i think we can take 2hrs a day as excessive",
    "i found a paper",
    "written by 1 of the same prof that was in the reading materials for this course",
    "but the reccomendation is for teens only",
    "got no studies i have seen so far that looked at adults",
    "is either young kids or teens",
    "i asked isaac see what he says",
    "if we do this means split >1680 n <1680",
    "if we do this whats the samples size for both",
    "hmm",
    "can perhaps ask prof ltr also",
    "u can try use either of the splits in the ancova first to see whats the output",
    "oh wow now positive",
    "the regression plots changed abit also now",
    "the efect size became -ve eh",
    "the data looks btr when we split by quartiles lol",
    "if we do this we can only conclude our findings based on the data we have (less generalisability)",
    "if we split by excessive then have more generalisability",
    "i tot is the opp? cos our h1 is males spend more time playing than females",
    "-ve means negative correlatin",
    "yes...",
    "ahh",
    "ok ya mb",
    "2nd one p value >0.05",
    "also",
    "oh i tot thats the case only for big e",
    "im not sure",
    "so prof say actually cos only simul game p value below 0.05 so we lookat the mean diff",
    "n we can see that actually the well being increased with more play time",
    "A is the low B is the high",
    "play time grp",
    "so mean for B is higher means that the well being actually increased for the higher play time grp",
    "prof actually q facinated with the result he ask if we want to actually publish it HAHA",
    "the effect size agrees with this also",
    "positive with large significance",
    "its an additional thing to confirm the interacion effects",
    "ya",
    "err yeah",
    "wah but to combine and assign the total play time per participant dam troublesome sia",
    "if we dw to split by 2hr as excessive prof say can split by median of the data also",
    "ooh",
    "yea",
    "if we want to focus just on the dataset then we shud do this",
    "i see",
    "im not q sure what to make of the post hoc for h1 and h2 yet also",
    "cos the output seems to go against what we concluded",
    "h1",
    "h2",
    "mean spane is lower for females",
    "idk y the mean is ard 1 for the playtime",
    "ya",
    "as in the mean(A) and mean(B) i tot is the mean time spent playing video games",
    "ohhhh",
    "right",
    "ahh now it makessense",
    "for h1 n h2 our conclusion we can say not v strong becos of the imbalanced dataset",
    "so when we study efect of gender the effect on females heavily skewed by the players of acnh",
    "cos most of the female population in our study is from that game",
    "yea",
    "ok at least we clear up the stuff alr",
    "yup",
    "jus need to decide how to split the data",
    "then i think everything else can settle",
    "can",
    "Isaac also say same thing as prof split by median so i guess we do that ba",
    "Ya based on the median",
    "Less work for us to go n add extra explanation for choosing thresholds for excessive game time",
    "i changed to split by median alr",
    "the result almsot the same as split by excessive",
    "Ancova use the raw age data as covariate",
    "The categorical data is only for the independent variable",
    "Can can",
    "eh i ran the deepnote n the regression stuff is still the same eh",
    "oh isaac didnt tell u for regression i think btr to use the raw time spent data",
    "i try to edit",
    "if i have any problems will let u know",
    "ohh",
    "i see",
    "kk",
    "looks gd",
    "thanks man",
    "yup i saw",
    "how was this done uh",
    "just curious maybe in future i might need to use'",
    "wah using what sia",
    "ohh",
    "so far i think the changes not alot uh",
    "jus minor tweaks in the data we mention in the analysis",
    "the col affect is the net spane score uh",
    "range is from -6 to 6",
    "ok",
    "Im more or less done updating the old stuff with the new data",
    "Less the part talking abt the median",
    "I got a presentation now after that i will continue",
    "HAHA yall dk uh",

    "sure",
    "i will do the ancova part then",
    "Oh ya fyi for rq1 i changed the interpretation of the results",
    "Even tho the regression showed some positive correlations the ancova indicated that all the correlations r actually negative",

    "Mask usage reduces the risk of contracting Covid-19, however, it has an immense resultant pollution from its usage. Experts estimate that globally each month, 129 billion disposable face masks are used and disposed. These masks are typically treated like medical waste, sanitised before ending up in landfills or being incinerated.\n\nMask debris has begun showing up in oceans, alarming conservationists around the world. In Singapore, clean-ups, organised by volunteer groups, have reported increases in the number of masks found in public areas; highlighting the need for the implementation of proper disposal practices for masks.\n \nAlthough the usage of reusable masks is more ideal, disposable masks are heavily used as it has better filtration. Industries, such as healthcare, are also mandated to use these single-use surgical masks. This presents a huge opportunity to improve its end-of-life processing.\n \nThus, our problem statement is \"How can we make the end-of-life processing and treatment of single-use surgical masks more environmentally friendly?\"\n\nOur proposed solution is to focus on collecting and recycling used disposable masks island-wide. To implement this, recycling kiosks will be set up to collect masks and reward users with points that can be redeemed for vouchers, similar to the Healthy 365 app. This promotes the recycling of single-use surgical masks and reduces the carbon footprint from its end-of-life processing.\n \nWe believe that this solution would be successful due to the success of precedents such as the plastic container recycling machines deployed across Singapore recently; where 50 such machines collected 4 million containers within the first 14 months. These machines were successful as the public received 50 cents for every 10 containers recycled, showcasing the effectiveness of inculcating recycling habits through a rewards system. Since masks are currently produced to a greater extent compared to plastic, we expect our solution to be even more successful as our target demographic is larger.\n \nThe collection and recycling of these single-use surgical masks can be done in partnership with an established company, such as Plaxtil, that is in the textile recycling industry. Plaxtil recycles polymers in textiles converting them into ecological plastics which can replace 100% petroleum-based plastics in other industries. Thus, not only do consumers benefit from the rewards that they can earn, but society also benefits from the reduced environmental impact and increase in resources.\n \nTo test the effectiveness of our proposed solution, we will focus on the willingness of the public to participate in the recycling drive by looking at the number of people participating and the frequency at which they recycle. We would also maximise the productive efficiency of converting textiles to plastics. This solution also reminds consumers and companies that trash doesn’t just disappear after it’s been thrown out, further, reducing the environmental impact caused by disposable masks.",

    "if still sag in that case maybe the structure don protrude as much?",
    "ya",
    "n i think the opening that cuts thru the whole building can try also",
    "cos if u do that u can run alot of the supports thru the hole",
    "ya",

    "1:100 and 1:50?",
    "ok",
    "i scale down n chop the bot part of the building in half but now my com hang",
    "i take a 15cm bounding box n crop out the rest uh",
    "ok",
    "might not be able to print the thin beams",
    "have to add in post cos too thin",
    "close up",
    "the thin ones",

    "Like the holes",
    "The 1:50 I will flip it on the side so it prints like a dome",
    "Can uh but 1:50 need building also?",
    "So like solid surface like a crystal ball lol",
    "HAHA ok",
    "1:50 like this rite?",
    "or remove the platforms n benches also",
    "Ok but now nico say this cannot print with his 3d printer",
    "Or rather can but removing the supports will be a pain",
    "Cos the beams all 2mm only mah",
    "Cos if print this",
    "Flip on the side mah",
    "Then in the hollow space will have supports",
    "I sent him the 1:100 model alr he gon print then afterwards maybe can try this",
    "Err",
    "Idk sia",
    "I shud ask him",
    "Yeah",
    "White ideally?",
    "Btw, i think yr dome the CAD might have issue, this hasnt happened to me at all in like months",
    "Idk",

    "Ya is a surface",
    "Like what prof Carlos did",

    "I prob try closing it",
    "I tot the supports will be able to carry it",
    "Haha",
    "Cos Carlos say sometimes can work",
    "So i took a gamble",

    "But will take dam long if do that",
    "i cant seem to make it a closed polysurface sia",
    "I sent to nico to try alr uh bit yeah",
    "The 1:50 model I think need to do like the method Carlos showed in the tutorial",
    "Using the connectors",
    "Ya",
    "Another option is ask fablab",
    "If can use this sla resin printer",
    "Nico say this one is for v fine detail prints",
    "Can one",
    "U heat it abit",
    "I ask nico abt this see if can try first",
    "Connectors one might have to increase diameter of the beams to 3mm at least",
    "Like thicken the beam abit so the connectors can be printed",
    "Artfriend got sell those thin wooden rods?",
    "HAHA true but that might be a bit too thin uh",
    "Ya",
    "But the connectors can't print that small",
    "That's why this^",

    "Main points (consideration leadership behaviour)\n- 2 major types of leadership behaviour, consideration and initiating structure \n- consideration is the extent to which a leader is approachable and shows personal care and concern for their employees\n- initiating structure is the degree to which the leader focuses on the attainment of group goals through clearly defined roles for every employee, often also stressing the adoption of standard procedures\n- At AC, the managers we interviewed work very closely with their mentees hence consideration leadership behaviour was observed in the way they led their mentees\n- they often made an effort to get to know their mentees, learning about their hobbies and interests, if it was sports like tennis they would go and play together regularly, we observe that they try to make their mentees see them like a friend in order to ensure good team dynamics\n- they would also engage them in regular small goal setting activities throughout the year and motivate them to be self driven to hit their goals\n- for 1 of our managers that we interviewed, it is especially important that he makes the effort to engage his mentees as he shared with us that in the past his lack of consideration for 1 of his mentee's own personal goals which did not align with his own led to conflict between the two\n- at AC, due to the nature of the work they do, networking and ensuring that one has good relationships with your associates is key to performing well in their industry. Hence, consideration leadership behaviour is employed by the people working there as it helps to maintain employee satisfaction and motivate them to succeed in hitting their performance goals",

    "i mean obv since u doing that slide right",
    "1. To weber religion helped drove capitalism as seen from calvinists n protestants\n3. Basically religion is at the core of how society functions but the main point is its not said by weber it was said by dukheim\n4. Go back to definition  of affectual social acts \"based on emotion, consequences not considered\" so the last part of the statement contradicts hence false\n10. They did agree but on specialisation in order to achieve efficiency not on the tendency to exchange",

    "I nvr read too much on the ai stuff",
    "Maybe i go see ltr",
    "I read more on the chips for com",
    "Like how the partnership could allow them to overtake intel cos they can design a chip that has gd cpu n gpu performance but be power efficient as well",
    "Cos power efficiency is the biggest drawback for intel n amd chips",
    "Whereas arm chips r optimised for power efficiency",
    "cos i mean like if u look at nvidia stock price right is dam inflated their valuation is like 27 times revenue or sth",
    "but they have such uge growth potential",
    "yeah",
    "i have no idea",
    "i guess cos they r unmatched currently in terms of chips with raw graphic processing power",
    "which games and 3d software modelling need",
    "maybe cos they have their coloud based gaming system rolling out soon as well",
    "they just launched their new gpu series as well",
    "ooh",

    "yeah",
    "functions uh?",
    "oh more stats uh",
    "mine so far is mostly calculus",
    "they integrate what we learn in math with physics so both learn stuff that is inter related at the same time one",
    "HAHA",

    "The template must follow strictly?",
    "In terms of the layout of the pics",
    "Err yes but for the text it must still be on left side for all the slides?",
    "Yeah the descriptions n explainations for the pictures",

    "ahh okay thankss",
    "Hi yinjie just now in class prof said that if i want to do a purely 2D design then it has to be 'very nice' so i was wondering if this is considered 'very nice'😂",

    "Thanks man",
    "hi yinjie how do u make sure that when u extrude u extrude to exactly 2.5mm",

    "or is this correct alr",
    "i just set a random value for now while designing the surface but will change ltr to make the thickness 2.5mm",
    "my units is mm",
    "so means i set to 2.5?",
    "ahh ok",
    "thankss",
    "oh but right i am currently designing in the dimensions of 20x20 cos doing it in 95x95 takes to long to render when i adjust the slider so when i scale it when exporting will the thickness also scale up?",
    "so i should extrude with the value which when scaled up will be 2.5",
    "ooh ok",
    "how to scale uh?😂 i tried baking then using the scale function in rhino but they only scale the points",
    "actually i think i figured it out",
    "i used the scale component  apply bounding box then check the dimensions",
    "yeah i calculate the scale factor for the length then use it for the scale component",
    "then i use that scale factor n work backwards to see how much to extrude",
